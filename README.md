# TON NFT

## Mint Helper package

### Work in progress, use only if you really need.

Just pass your collection config and wallet config to Deploy Function and your collection will be deployed.

Before deployment, please make sure that you have at least 1 TON on wallet balance.

Also, you can mint as much NFT as your want, just make sure to make 30 seconds pause between mint, and ensure that collection wallet has enough TON on balance.

For more info check ```example.js```

Make sure your wallet is already activated and you are using **v4R2** version address.
